# EF Frontend Dev Task

I have successfully completed the EF Frontend Development Task using Vanilla JavaScript. The project was developed by starting with a Vanilla JavaScript setup using the latest version of Vite.

In this task, I diligently converted the provided design into a static HTML page, utilizing SCSS for styling and pure JavaScript for interactivity. The landing page consists of various sections, including the navigation bar, sub-navigation bar, hero section, and a trending product section.

## Built With

- `JavaScript`
- `SCSS`
- `HTML`
- `Vite`

## Features

- Filtering: Users can utilize the filtering options in the sub-navigation bar to refine their search results based on specific criteria.
- Advanced Search: The advanced search feature can be activated by clicking on the search button. Users can close the advanced search by clicking on the cross button.
